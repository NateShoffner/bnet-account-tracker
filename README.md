# BattleNet Account Tracker

Allows easy tracking of Overwatch accounts and their various account details (email, battletag) and stats (level, skill ratings).


Requirements:

```
pip install tabulate
pip install wcwidth
pip install pyperclip
```

Running via the command prompt might not display certain characters properly, so the Powershell script is recommended.

```
./run.ps1
```
